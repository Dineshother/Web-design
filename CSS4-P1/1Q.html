<h1 id="main">Airplane</h1>
<p>An airplane (North American English), an aeroplane (British English), often shortened to plane, is a fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller, or rocket engine.[1]</p>
<h2 class="sub1">History</h2>
<p>Many stories from antiquity involve flight, such as the Greek legend of Icarus and Daedalus, and the Vimana in ancient Indian epics</p>
<h4 class="sub1">Early powered flights</h4>
<p>The Frenchman Clement Ader constructed his first of three flying machines in 1886, the Ã‰ole. It was a bat-like design run by a lightweight steam engine of his own invention, with four cylinders developing 20 horsepower (15 kW), driving a four-blade propeller. </p>
